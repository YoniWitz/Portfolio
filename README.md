## Summary

With the new year approaching, I'd like to expand my profile which describes my programming skills to include wider and diverse capabilities. Ultimately, my goal is to land a job which incorporates these multiple skills. I would also like to demonstrate my abilities and wide knowledge of the craft. 
Therefore, I have begun revising the site and adding apps to my GitHub repo.
