## Summary

I began participating in a 'Software Development Mastermind' mentorship program towards the end of 2019. The purpose of the program is to strengthen and expand my skills as a Full Stack developer. The completed work is showcased on my GitHub and portfolio/personal website.

This is my portfolio website which I built myself. 

My ultimate goal is to land a job that incorporates my skills and utilizes my abilities and outgoing personality. So if you enjoyed reviewing my code as much as I did writing it, please find me on one of the links provided below.
